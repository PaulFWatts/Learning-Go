	1. for is Go’s only looping construct. Here are some basic types of for loops.
	2. The most basic type, with a single condition.
	3. A classic initial/condition/after for loop.
	4. for without a condition will loop repeatedly until you break out of the loop or return from the enclosing function.
	5. You can also continue to the next iteration of the loop.
